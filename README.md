In this I have performed a Python Pandas Workshop, first run for 
PyLadies NYC at Flatiron Health (May 2019). A mix of Pandas and 
"how to get started with data analysis" using realistic healthcare data. 
In this Project, I will be using a Jupyter notebook and the Pandas 
library to explore oncology treatment data. You will not only get an 
introduction to data analysis using Pandas, but also get a glimpse of the 
kind of healthcare data that engineers at Flatiron wrangle on a daily 
basis.
In this project I am trying to get different aspects and they are:
1) Loading and inspecting the data.
• Looking into unique patients.
• Knowing information about a particular patient/patients.
• Getting information about the rows which have dosages less 
than or greater than particular value.
• Sorting the data frame or a particular series.
• Modifying the data frame.
2)Cleaning the data.
• Data conversions and giving them the correct data types.
3)Data analysis.
• How many patients does the practice treat?
• What are the drugs used at the practice and how many patients receive those 
drugs?
• Do we see any changes in treatment patterns over time?
4) Data visualization
• A simple bar chart in Seaborn to compare counts for the two 
drugs.
• Plotting the number of starts per month per drug against.
• Plotting the boxplot of dosages vs drugs to see the average 
dosage of each drug
